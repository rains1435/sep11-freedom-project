# Entry 1: WHAT AND HOW?

##### 11/3/25

## What am I making exactly???

Unlike last school year (SEP10) where I made a project that tackles a larger, foreseeable issue (Ignorance of Personal Finance), this year (SEP11), I plan to create something more creative, something more fun than addressing an issue (A Game). The game genre is puzzle + dungeon based game that requires LOGIC.

### Game: Escaping Demise
* 6-7 levels (6 MAIN STORYLINE Levels + 1 BONUS Level)
* Small plot/story that follows as you complete each level
* There will be a background story of how your character is trapped in a dungeon before the game starts

**WARNING:** THIS IS THE DRAFT/EXPECTATION OF WHAT I AM GOING TO CREATE AND MY IDEAS MIGHT CHANGE.

#### PARTNERSHIP:
I am partners with Xin Yu on this project and I don't know much about what he's going to do but we're going to start planning later on.

## How???

### Tool: **[Phaser](https://phaser.io/)**

I chose to use the phaser tool to create my game and same with my partner Xin Yu. I had other options before **[Phaser](https://phaser.io/)** but those were short-lived because I didn't like them. For example, **[Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/)** looked fun to use for my 2D dungeon game but it also looks TOO simple and I feared that simplicity might restrict me from doing certain things. However, with Phaser, when I looked at some of the games such as **[Battery Bot](https://phaser.io/news/2025/09/battery-bot)**, it seemed more promising than what Kaboom might offer. Also after looking JUST at the "**[Making your first Phaser 3 game](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game)**", it fully incentivitzed me to pick phaser; the tutorial on how to make the game is easy to understand because all there is to it is to preload assets, put assets into the content/canvas area, and make it function with easy to digest code. (FOR ME AT LEAST).

### **[Tinkering](../tool/phaser-tinkering.html)**
**[Learning Logs](../tool/learning-log.md)** -> to follow along. Before I start, I am not a professional at using phaser nor do I have knowledge to know everything. Anyways, let's begin with how I created my game canvas or the area where all the content is in. I copyied all the highlighted code from **[Here](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1#:~:text=var%20config%20%3D%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20type%3A%20Phaser.AUTO%2C%0A%20%20%20%20width%3A%20800%2C%0A%20%20%20%20height%3A%20600%2C%0A%20%20%20%20scene%3A%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20preload%3A%20preload%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20create%3A%20create%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20update%3A%20update%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%7D%3B%0A%0Avar%20game%20%3D%20new%20Phaser.Game(config)%3B)**. Then I would center the canvas with `style.css` (Did a bit of styling too!). It should result in a 800 by 600 black screen canvas at the center. To be honest, the canvas looked boring so I tried to figure how to get a background but it was impossible since I didn't have Phaser's assets folder downloaded (Didn't have phaser's texture CDN/ [Source](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part2)). I got creative and downloaded some of my own assets/images online to store it into my newly created assets folder (It was just a sky image that I used for the background). Lastly, I linked the image into the `function preload` so I can use the assets in the `function create`. The End.

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)
I am on the first step, **Define the Problem**, of the EDP. My apologies for not discussing the problem in the content area but I feel it's better for me to discuss it here. The problem we have in hand is boredom and boredom can be caused by a lot of factors such as LITERALLY HAVING NOTHING ELSE TO DO BUT STARE AT A WALL. Also, in my opinion, logical games should see a rise in the "fun" industry even it might sound counter-intuitive because who would want a boring difficult logical math game? My point is, we have two problems at hand: boredom and the lack of logical games viewed as hardwork rather than being fun. Hopefully, my game will try to combat these problems easily.

## Skills

### CREATIVITY
Am I really creative for thinking about this game, a game that can be easily replicated? Now hear me out... Although the game seems like another copy and paste from certain games (I can't say it or else I'll be copyrighted), I feel like the problems I am trying to solve with this game is what makes the project creative. Don't believe me? Let's start from what creativity skill is: to think outside the box. Now tell me, who would ever think of trying to solve boredom? Maybe a lot of people... but then who would EVER think about making logical games fun? Exactly, it's outside the box. By the way, these thoughts are bedtime thoughts but it sets the precedent for how I developed in my creativity skills, regardless if it is like 10% increase (**any progress will be counted!**)

### LOGICAL REASONING & ORGANIZATION
Javascript, the very fun programming language that later down the line, forces a lot of logical statements into my poor brain. Do I tolerate it? Yes and you may wonder why. I made it obvious (**The title says it all**)... I've improved A LOT with logical reasoning and organization, especially those LONG deltamath assignments a certain SOMEBODY gives out (Mr. Mueller). I appreciate his persistence in trying to keep us in check and not slack off. For example, the **DelaMath Conditionals**, where you had to organize the un-tabbed the curly bracket `{}` and it was so bad for the few 30 minutes until I finally figured it out. At that point, all it took was organization skills and voilà, I ranked up in organizaiton! Then after the curly bracket questions, there were a lot of conditional statements (`if`...). For example, the Logic Gates questions required a lot of logical reasoning because it would give given trues or falses on A,B, and sometimes C. Then you'll have to make them go through "modifiers" which changes their identity to either true or false. Lastly, those `or` and `and` terms were the death of me since I had no idea what I was looking at. However, I figured it out (`or` = either one has to be true, `and` = both have to be true) and I breezed through those questions with my GREATLY improved logical reasoning skills. (**Mr. Mueller should post more logical themed delta-maths**)

## Next Step
**I'm hoping for EDP step 2**, research the problem, to be done in the next blog entry. In other words, I want to do some extra investigating to confirm that boredom is an actual gaming issue and if logical games are less or more entertaining in these days. I plan to research on these specified topics but not 100% confirmed yet. **Anyways have a great day!**
